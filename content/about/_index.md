Hello World. Iâ€™m Torben, a 22-year-old System Administrator from Germany.

In my free time, I explore Computer Science, OSINT, play games, spend time in nature, and consume a wide range of media, from anime and manga to series, movies, and books. I'm also learning Japanese, and as you might have guessed, I have a deep interest in Japanese culture, appreciating both its beauty and its complexities.

I'm the owner of [CatsAreBeautiful.de](https://catsarebeautiful.de), a personal project that hosts various privacy-friendly frontends and websites for friends.

I'm always looking to learn, grow, and connect with others who share similar interests.
